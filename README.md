FinalProject - Milestone 2
============

1.    Introduction -- Prototype of Bomb Disposal Robot. 

1.1. Name of the assignment: Milestone 2 -- Scanner beacon bearing and wall distance accuracy. Due 10/31.

1.2. Team Number 5. Team members include Corey Short (Mechanical), Khoa Tran (Programmer), Peter Nguyen (Programmer),
     and Trevor Davenport (Report).

1.3. Approximate number of person hours spent on the project: 20+ Hours.

2.    Experimental work  (if any):  Use charts and tables where useful

2.1. Experiment description and purpose: The purpose of this Milestone is to successfully modify and test the Scanner class
                                         to return an array of Beacon bearings. The purpose of this project is to create a basis
                                         for our final project which includes being able to detect a bomb.

2.2. Listing of data: Within our project folder you will find 3 separate Excel Files (Beacon Scanning Chart, Wall Distance Tests, and a
                      Final Scanning Test). When using the coordinates (30,20) we found that there was a difference of roughly 5.36%.
                      When using the coordinates (240, 210) the discrepancies were nearly 14.29%.

2.3. Calculations and analysis: ![Chart](https://raw.github.com/IEOR140-T5/FinalProject-NXT/master/reports/chart-part1.png)
