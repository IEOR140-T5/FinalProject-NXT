                                             FINAL PROJECT -- MILESTONE 5A




***Introduction***:
1.1 Name of Assignment: Final Project Milestone 5A - Simple Map Method

1.2 Lab team number: 5

***Team Members***:

Phuoc Nguyen, Khoa Tran (NXT Part)

Corey Short, Trevor Davenport (PC Part)

1.3 Approximate number of person hours spent on the project: 20 hours

1.4 Project Code: Steam/TEAM/TEAM 5/Final Project (All Milestone)/Milestone5

***Performance Specification***:
Our robot meets all the specification for this milestone. Our Rover is able to Map out the surrounding area by using Locator's
calculations of a new pose and combining it with a dead reckoning pose. This is accomplished by making two complete circuits (rectangles)
and fixing the pose when the robot reaches a corner.

***Objective***: Milestone 5B requires the same specifications as Milestone 5A, however, we are now navigating a more complex map.                                               
                                                            
***Modifications to Code***: The changes to our code include:
